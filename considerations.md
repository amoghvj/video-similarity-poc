# Future Considerations and Ideas

## Full-Video Vectorization Models

Vectorizing *every single frame* of a video using a standard image model like CLIP is generally a bad idea for production due to computational expense and the loss of temporal context (motion and sequence). For future versions, consider **Video Foundation Models (Spatiotemporal Models)**:

### 1. Twelve Labs API (Marengo / Pegasus Models)
Arguably the gold standard for this right now. They don't just extract frames; their models create **multimodal video embeddings**. They process the video, audio, and speech simultaneously, allowing for semantic searches (e.g., "the exact moment a guy in a red shirt drops his coffee").

### 2. VideoCLIP / X-CLIP (Open Source)
To keep the architecture entirely local and open-source, consider upgrading from standard CLIP to **VideoCLIP** or **X-CLIP**. These are modified versions of the CLIP architecture specifically designed to take in video clips rather than single images, allowing them to capture temporal relationships (motion) between frames.

### 3. VideoMAE (Video Masked Autoencoders)
Developed by researchers at Meta and Tencent, VideoMAE is an open-source model highly optimized for action recognition and video representation. It's computationally efficient because it compresses the video spatially and temporally before vectorizing it.

### 4. Gemini 1.5 Pro / GPT-4o (API Route)
Modern LLMs have massive multimodal context windows. You can feed an entire video file directly into Gemini 1.5 Pro, and it will process the temporal context natively. While not a traditional "vector database" approach, it is excellent for video summarization, anomaly detection, or similarity comparisons if an API-driven solution is acceptable.

**Recommendation:** If budget allows, using **Twelve Labs** will save massive amounts of infrastructure headaches. If it must remain open-source and local, migrating from `CLIP` to `VideoCLIP` is the most logical next step.
